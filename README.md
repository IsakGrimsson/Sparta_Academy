# My repo README file

Hi Paula & Tommy

I completed the python fundamentals course before starting the academy and I didn't keep the code I wrote for it anymore
But I'm quite familiar with python and have been writing code regularly for the last year in it (you can see my other repos on github for more)
I also added the notes I took when I was originally getting to grips with it into the 'Python Notes' folder as something tangible at least
